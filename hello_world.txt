So I was taking a walk today 
And then
and then
		I found something
		A boy
		With some ungodly... entity floating over his shoulder, unbeknownst to the boy.
	
	I said, "Um, son?"

	"Yeah? What's up, sir?"

	The ... thing, it-it looked at me.
	There was no set-in-stone eye, or pair of eyes, but I could feel it observing every fibre of my being. I could feel it taking an interest in me.

	"Wh-who's your friend?" I shakily asked, a shiver slithering up and down my spine alerting me that I should be anywhere but near this child.

	The boy had a confused look, tapping his chin in contemplation. Then, as if he heard a whisper I wasn't privy to, he looked over his shoulder and smiled, "Oh, this is Timmy! He's my guardian angel! Say hi Timmy!"

	"Timmy" s p o k e, and at that particular moment, I knew what hell, heaven, purgatory, life, death, good, evil, duality and unity was all at once.

	I screamed, then I woke up naked, tied to a tree in the woods.
